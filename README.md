# Ligand-Net-Workflow
This workflow helps the user to determine whether a set of ligands act as actives or decoys when it comes to bind to a specific protein.

## Getting Started
These set of instructions will help you understand and develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict ligands as actives or decoys. This workflow generates classification models based on different approach that the user may choose. Those include the following:

* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest (RF)
* Extra Tree Classifier (ETC)
* Neural Networks (NN)

You can either choose one approach to develop a classification model or you may choose all of them. Either way we will run different parameters to find the best model that fits your data; in other words, we will select the one that gives the highest Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity.
